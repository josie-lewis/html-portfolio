<h3>1. About Time</h3>
   <p>Beautifully poignant film about coming to terms with the passing of time, and acceptance of life's twists and turns.</p>
<h3>2. The Secret Life of Walter Mitty</h3>
   <p>A very cinematically beautiful film, creatively produced. It takes you on an adventure and inspires you to step out. 10/10 love.</p>
<h3>3. The Polar Express</h3>
   <p>Yes, I  know, it is a christmas film.<br />But it still deserves a place in my top 3 films.<br />A beautifully crafed film about belief, courage, and adventure.</p>
